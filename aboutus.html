            <p>Hi, I'm a first year undergraduate student from Ontario, studying Software Engineering at U of Windsor! Through building this website I learned many new skills, such as Web Development, setting up websites, and debugging code when there are problems. This is my first hackathon and I'll be at another as this was such a fun experience!</p>
