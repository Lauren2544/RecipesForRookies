            <h3>Condensed Milk Bread!</h3>
        <p> Country originated in:  Japan </br>
Yield: 4 servings</br></br>
            Ingredients:</br>
- 250g all purpose flour </br>
- 1/4 tsp salt</br>
- 3 tbsp sugar</br>
- 3g yeast (active/instant)</br>
- 3/4 cup warm milk (110F) </br>
- 30g cubed unsalted butter(room temperature) </br>
- Fillings (optional) Walnuts/cream cheese/cranberries/raisins</br></br>

Directions: </br>
1.	In a large bowl, mix flour and salt together. </br>
2.	If you are using active dry yeast, make sure you let the yeast and sugar sit in the warm milk for 5-10minutes. For instant yeast, you can just mix them with the flour immediately. </br>
3.	Pour the yeast mixture into the dry ingredients. Add condensed milk. Mix until the mixture comes together</br>
4.	If you have a stand mixer, you can use it. Otherwise, you can hand knead it.</br>
5.	Transfer the dough into the work surface. Use a rubbing motion at first because it is too sticky to throw. It should take around 10-15minutes. Once it does not stick to your hand, add in butter. Make sure you mix the butter that is on the table as well. Continue kneading for 5-10 minutes. Once it does not stick to your hand, you can use the window pane test to see if it is well kneaded.</br> 
6.	Put the dough into a well greased bowl. Cover with plastic cling wrap or towel and let it rise in a warm place for 2h or until double in size.</br>
7.	If you want to add filling, feel free to chop the walnuts. </br>
8.	Once it is risen, transfer the dough onto a lightly floured surface. Punch down the air and divide into 8 equal pieces. Press down the dough and add in fillings you like. Shape each piece into a ball. </br>
9.	Place the rolls onto a baking pan with parchment paper. Cover and let it rise in a warm place for 1h</br>
10.	Preheat the oven at 350F. </br>
11.	You can brush the rolls with milk or egg wash(1 egg with 1tbsp cold water) if you like the golden colour. </br>
12.	Bake at 320F for 10 minutes then at 320F for 17minutes.  </br>
13.	Once they are baked, let it cool to room temperature. Feel free to sprinkle with icing sugar. </br>

Tips </br>
1. If the environment is too cold, you can put the bowl or pan onto a heater. Or put the bowl or pan into the oven without turning it on. Place warm water next to the bowl. This helps create a warm environment for gluten to develop</br>
2. When you are kneading, the dough is really sticky. Be patient and continue kneading. Use a scrapper to help. Donâ€™t flour the dough when you are kneading. Eventually, it will come together and your hands will be clean.</br>
